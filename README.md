## Awards
###HooHacks, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, Charlottesville, VA 
###Best Use of Google Cloud Platform, Mar 2019
My team built an iOS app where the app reads the contents of the userâ€™s Google Drive documents. Then, processes each document with nltk and using vector analysis cluster the documents into groups before finally copying each file into new sorted folders in Drive.
The front-end is an iOS app that sends requests to our Google Cloud Functions backend which parses the request to sort the data. A NodeJS cloud function receives all of the requests from the app, then sends the appropriate sub-request to other methods that use NodeJS and Python.

###BlairHacks_2 MONTGOMERY BLAIR HIGH SCHOOL, Silver Spring, MD 
###Best Overall, UX Polish, Best Hardware Hack, Dec 2018
My team built an iOS app that allows you to add songs to a shared Alexa queue and vote on songs to determine their place in the queue. It is built on Azure using Azure functions with javascript and Azure Cosmos DB, a frontend iOS app using Swift, and Spotify and Alexa used for streaming music.
